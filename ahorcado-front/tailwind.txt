module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
To ensure that your Tailwind CSS configuration file is correctly set up, you should also have a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root directory. The content you provided is already a valid Tailwind CSS configuration file. Here is a complete example for clarity:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Steps to Set Up Tailwind CSS

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**: If you haven't already installed Tailwind CSS, you can do so using npm or yarn.

```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss
   # or
   yarn add -D tailwindcss
   ```

2. ** Initialize Tailwind CSS**: Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```
   This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file with default settings.

3. **Configure Your Template Paths**: Update the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file to include the paths to all of your template files. This ensures that Tailwind will scan these files for class names and generate the corresponding CSS.
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],}
